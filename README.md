#Real Time STFT Programs in ARM Cortex M4/M7 MCUs
Here, I upload the .h and .c files I cretaed and developed for computing the Short Time Fourier Transform for 6 channels in a biosignal acquisition unit I designed. The STFT comes in handy when
assessing the frequency characteristics of a signal. It produces the magnitude spectrum for the signal and can be usefull in evaluating certain features of the signal.
